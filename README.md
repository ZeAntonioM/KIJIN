## üéÆ Game Description

**KIJIN** is a 2D puzzle game with a dark, sketch-style aesthetic.  
The protagonist, **Carol**, finds herself trapped in a mysterious room, trying to reach the surface.

Carol has a unique ability to **synthesize with special boxes**, allowing her to manipulate their **scale in an inverted manner**:
- When she **shrinks** a box, **she grows**.  
- When she **enlarges** a box, **she shrinks**.

To escape, Carol must **strategically choose** between boxes and decide which of the two synthesis options to use, solving scale-based puzzles that challenge her perception of size and space.
